In this project I had explored the staging data table that I cleaned in data cleaning process. Initially I take the dataset in kaggle website then I read the data set and continued cleaning.
The cleaned dataset contains the actual data about the companies laid off around the world since 2020.
I had analyzed the data by month, stage,year, company, industry .
The main objective of the project is that I analyze the conclusion of top 5 companies that laid off their employees between the year 2020 to 2023.
